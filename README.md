Particle Fire Simulation
- This was my first main c++ project that I did.
- I made use of the SDL library for the animation effects.
- The script that I created generated 7000 'particles' that would
move in individualized directions.
- I used a box filter to blur the movement of the particles and ensured that the particles
returned into the center of the screen upon exiting the screen frame.
- Additionally, I added a color changing effect to add the visual nature of the project.

Enjoy !! :]
